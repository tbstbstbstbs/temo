For many of you that know me, you've scratched your heads with some of the choices I have made in order to be closer to the source of change... well, this is one of them.

Whether that meant going to an art school no one had heard about, dropping out to get an engineering degree instead, entering the architecture industry during the recession, jumping into the scrappy inner workings beneath fashion's marketed facade, traveling to see how people in other parts of the world lived when people said I should have been climbing the corporate ladder, or more recently, packing my bags for the Bay Area after an "aha" moment during a conversation in Brooklyn – I opted in for experiential and intellectual wealth over money – much to the chagrin and puzzlement of family and friends over the social/financial risks I was willing to take. Without really understanding at the time that I was hungry to understand the sources and mechanics behind innovation, I spent my 20's in the privilege and liberty to explore and discover what moved people and why they did the things the did.

I was lucky enough to discover through a roommate that software touched all these vectors of interest, and even luckier to learn that Javascript was at a point in its evolution as a scripting language where its range of impact ran from top to bottom, pixel to metal, and developers could make lean programs in Javascript as front-end, full-stack, or data science/back-end engineers. I have had some exposure to Java and Ruby/Python, and anticipate Javascript's nuances, caveats, and strengths, which I hope to flush out here on this blog as I learn the language.

As a springboard for this blog, I was accepted to Hack Reactor and recently started the precourse material in preparation for the February start date at their San Francisco location. As a newcomer to Silicon Valley, where I've found the healthiest irreverence towards friction to change and resistance to disruption (maybe another blog post), I can't think of a better place, time, and catalyst to transition from exploration to pragmatism – and make things that enable and inspire people to move forward, if they see value in doing so and only if they want to.

#### Why Hack Reactor

Hack Reactor, like many programming intensives or development bootcamps, is met with much skepticism and doubt as to whether the program is good for a nascent programmer and/or the developer ecosystem. Whether the skepticism is valid or not, one thing for certain is that an onsite intensive accelerates the heuristic feedback loop by:

* providing a context for multiple learning modalities: paired programming, lectures, exercises, making and building stuff (it's not just you and your laptop, maybe with a book, connected to the web – though this is great for focus at times)
* fit(ness) through exposure and familiarization with culture, pacing, and leads in the industry
* adopting and practicing industry standards, group dynamics, and workflows in a sandbox – just in case you break the code

But even stronger than these is the accountability and expectations of people who seek a community with the same goals. Sure, you can get the same information through Flanagan's Definitive Guide, peruse through tutorials online, or start anywhere by building an app, as ugly as it may turn out under (or above) the hood for the first few iterations. However, within a tribe, you're able to compound the effects of learning with your peers.

The more I've learned about Hack Reactor, I've found that it has the strongest engineering culture as a development program with the quality and relevance of instruction, community, and a "learning-first" business model that permeates HR culture and happiness of students. Hack Reactor is a tribe that enables its members to move towards being multipliers of one another. Where the developer takes it from there is up to him and the strength of the support structure; HR graduates have continued access to resources and support (and I'm finding my cohort is pretty awesome!).

#### We all start somewhere, software as a co-op structure

Coming into Hack Reactor, a lot of us are pivoting from other walks of life and bringing in different interests and drives for programming – things that motivate us to "aim passed the chopping block" as we work towards efficacy, skill, and impact through our code. On a sliding scale of 0.0 to 3.0, where each whole number represents a threshold in professional development, Michael Church has an interesting perspective on the trajectory of a software engineer where someone starting out begins as a subtracter (0.0), becomes an adder (1.0), then a multipler (2.0). Hack reactor has a proven track record of taking passionate and dedicated entrants passed the first threshold at 1.0 in three months. As mentioned on their site regarding their students: many Hack Reactor graduates have transitioned directly into mid-to-senior level programmers at top Bay Area companies, including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and more, excelling in positions that typically require a CS degree and two or more years of engineering experience.

Also, software – as a medium – is what Michael points out to be one of the most structurally cooperative systems. The growth and well-being of developers is "correlated positively with the performance of others in the industry, even when they’re nominally (and transiently) 'competitors'. Great programmers teach other programmers to be great and build great technologies, which are often released into the open-source community." This on top of the fact that software is eating the world makes the vehicle a multiplier in the hands of multipliers.

Hack Reactor is a tribe of prospective multipliers. Live and breathing code, as a vehicle, is a multiplier. The intensity and rigor of HR's system is a multiplier of the feedback loop. As an onsite program, HR introduces us to a zeitgeist of multipliers within the larger developer community of SF/Silicon Valley. For someone starting out now, it's an amazing opportunity.

With that, I look forward to being part of a new tribe of multipliers in their own right, cohort H25.
